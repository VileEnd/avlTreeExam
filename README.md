[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/VileEnd/avlTreeExam/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/VileEnd/avlTreeExam/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This repository encapsulates an AVL tree implementation in both JavaScript and Java. It provides a visual representation through a web interface, allowing users to interact with the AVL tree dynamically.

## 🎯 Features 🎯
- **Node Insertion**: Add nodes and observe the tree balance dynamically.
- **Rotations**: Supports Right, Left, Right-Left, and Left-Right rotations.
- **Tree Traversals**: Displays Pre-order, In-order, Post-order traversals.
- **Rotation Count Tracking**: Tracks and displays the count of each rotation type.
- **Tree Statistics**: Shows the depth and balance of the tree.

## 💡 Future Enhancements 💡
- **Deletion**: Implement node deletion while maintaining balance.
- **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to find nodes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Display metrics like time taken for operations, comparisons made, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance the UI to be responsive for better mobile support.

## 🚀 Usage 🚀
- Web Interface: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
- Java Implementation: Run the Java code to see AVL tree operations in the console.
