# 🌲 AVL Tree Visualization 🌲

[![Build Status](https://github.com/VileEnd/avlTreeExam/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/VileEnd/avlTreeExam/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This repository contains an AVL tree implementation in JavaScript and Java. It provides a visual interface through a web page, allowing users to interact with the AVL tree in real-time.

## 🎯 Features 🎯
- **Node Insertion**: Add nodes to the tree and watch the tree balance itself dynamically.
- **Rotations**: Supports Right, Left, Right-Left, and Left-Right rotations.
- **Tree Traversals**: Displays Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversals.
- **Rotation Count Tracking**: Keeps track and displays the count of each type of rotation.
- **Tree Statistics**: Displays the depth and balance factor of the tree.
- **Node Deletion**: Implements node deletion while maintaining the balance of the tree.
- **Search Functionality**: Includes a search bar to locate nodes in the tree.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays metrics such as time taken for operations, number of comparisons made, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is responsive for better mobile device support.

## 💡 Future Enhancements 💡
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Implement an redo feature to allow users to reapply their actions.
- **Bulk Operations**: Allow users to  delete multiple nodes at once.
- **Animation Speed Control**: Provide a slider to control the speed of the animations.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode for the user interface.

## 🚀 Usage 🚀
- Web Interface: Visit [https://vileend.github.io/avlTreeExam/](https://vileend.github.io/avlTreeExam/) to interact with the AVL tree or clone the repo and access the index.html in your browser
- Java Implementation: Run the Java code to observe AVL tree operations in the console.
